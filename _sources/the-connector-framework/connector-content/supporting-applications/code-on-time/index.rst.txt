Code On Time
============

Code on Time is an Intelligent App Generator to build premium database
applications.

We have selected to apply this powerful product as it works very well
with MS SQL and can rapidly deploy a new application with minimum
effort. Applications around M-Files can be rapidly deployed using the
MFSQL Connector to expose the M-Files metadata in SQL and manage the
integration between M-Files and SQL while Code on Time will interact
with SQL to present the application to the end user.

There is no requirement to use Code on Time. The developer can use any
platform that is suitable to interact with SQL. Â Is some cases it may
even be sufficient to use SSMS without any additional UI layer to
explore and use the metadata in the tables.
