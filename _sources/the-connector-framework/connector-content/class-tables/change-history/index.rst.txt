Object change history
=====================

The :doc:`/tables/tbMFObjectChangeHistory/` table include the object change history across all classes

MFSQL allows for extracting the change history for specific objects and for specific properties of these objects.

The data is shown as a row for each version and property change.  The table includes data accross all classes but will only show the data that has previously been extracting using the related procedures.

The table :doc:`/tables/tbMFChangeHistoryUpdateControl/` is used for setting up the properties and tables to be included in the get history process.
