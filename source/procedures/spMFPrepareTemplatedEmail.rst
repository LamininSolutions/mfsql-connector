The procedure will compile the email based on the columns in the email Template table for the object identified by the Document_ID and send it using spMFSendHTMLBodyEmail.

This procedure may have to be customised for your specific application and use.

Additional Info
===============

Set IncludeTable parameter to 1 and then customise the procedure to include the designated table in the code MODIFY THIS SECTION FOR SELECTION OF THE TABLE

If the placeholder of the body is defined as '{head}' then it would use the default CSS defined in MFSettings as the email head.

Two placeholders have been defined as examples : '{firstname}, {user}'. The use of the placeholders are optional.  Additional placeholders can be defined following the same pattern as these two placeholders.
