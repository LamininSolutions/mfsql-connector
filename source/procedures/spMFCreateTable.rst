Purpose
=======

To create table for a class with associate properties and other custom columns (like ID, GUID, MX\_User\_ID, MFID, ExternalID, MFVersion, FileCount, IsSingleFile, Update\_ID, and LastModified)
The column **IncludedInApp** in the MFCLass table is set to 1 for the created class table.

Additional Info
===============

Class tables are not added by the Connector on deployment. The class tables are added by the developer using the Connector for those M-Files classes that will be used in the application.

Table Name
----------

The name of the class table is defined in column TableName in the MFClass Table. The Connector will create a default name for all the tables. These names can be customised.

Column Name
-----------

The name of the column is defined in the MFProperty Table in **ColumnName**. These names can be customised.
Several special columns are automatically created:

- Metadata structure properties
- Standard or system properties
- Additional properties
- Columns for special purposes
- Non Connector columns

The column order also has a very specific order.

Property Column Definitions
---------------------------

The metadata structure property columns in the Class Table is defined in the MFClassProperty table.
Single and multi-lookup properties will have both a label column and a ID column, for example Customer and Customer_ID. The label column is incidental and does not have to be updated when changes are made. Only the ID have to be updated. The name column will be automatically refreshed from the metadata.
If the metadata is a required property as defined in the MFClassProperty table then the column will be created with a NOT NULL constraint.

MF Addidional Property
----------------------

M-Files allow the addition of ad-hoc properties. When a property is dropped from the metadata definition in M-Files and already have values on an object, then the property will retain its value.

When the Connector finds an additional property on an object, and it is not part of the metadata card, then a column will be added to the end of the Class Table with the columnname and datatype definitions as previously described.

Non Connector Columns
---------------------

It is possible to add columns to the class table that will be ignored by the Connector but is available for processing in the application. These columns must have a prefix of MX\_ (for example MX_SAGE_Code)

Notwithstanding the ability to add additional columns to the Connector tables following the convension above, it is recommended to create additional tables for custom applications that is cross referenced to the Connector tables rather than adding columns to Connector tables.

=======================  ===============  ================================================================  ================

Prerequisites
=============

Class name exist
MFClass table contains names of the valid classes

Warnings
========

Drop and recreate to reset a class table when the table name is customised in MFClass
When an additional property is added in M-Files to an object the column will automatically be added at the end of the table.

Examples
========

.. code:: sql

   EXEC spMFCreateTable 'Customer'

----

.. code:: sql

   DECLARE    @return_value int
   EXEC       @return_value = [dbo].[spMFCreateTable]
              @ClassName =  N'Customer'
   SELECT    'Return Value'  = @return_value
   GO
