Purpose
=======

This procedure is specially useful when the metadata design in the vault has changed over time and properties that is not used any longer is still remaining on the metadata card.  Instead of manually deleted these properties from the metadata card, they can be deleted in bulk using the Connector.

Additional Info
===============

When a class table is refreshed in SQL and the properties are not defined on the metadata card, but are still on the object then it will be added as a separate column towards the end of the Class Table list of columns.

Using this procedure can delete these columns and delete it from the metadata.

Prerequisites
=============

There is a few requirements or steps to be taken to use this procedure:

- Identify the adhoc columns towards the end of the Class Table column list.
- Any column that is not a default column can be specified.
- The property will only be removed from the metadata card if there are no objects with values for that property any longer.
- If the property is set on the metadata card it, the value will be set to Null but it will not be removed.

Examples
========

.. code:: sql

    DECLARE @return_value int
    EXEC    @return_value = [dbo].[spMFDeleteAdhocProperty]
                                  @MFTableName =  N'MFCustomer',
                                  @columnNames =  N'Address',
                                  @process_ID = 5,
                                  @Debug =  NULL
    SELECT  'Return Value' = @return_value
