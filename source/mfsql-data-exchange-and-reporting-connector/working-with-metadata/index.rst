Working with Metadata
=====================

Why synchronising the metadata
------------------------------

The vault structure is captured in metadata baseline tables such as classes, object types etc.  Synchronizing the metadata updates the metadata structure of the specific vault into these inter related tables. These tables are use by MFSQL Connector to process against a replica structure of the vault. Note the following special considerations.

Refer to :doc:`/the-connector-framework/connector-content/metadata-structure-tables/index` for more details on the structure tables 
All ValueListItems are contained in a single table. The column AppRef
contains a unique reference that can be used in applications to access a
ValuelistItem without reference to the valuelist. The AppRef consists of
the Valuelist MFID and the Item MFID and is automatically created by the
Connector.

The spMFCreateLookupView procedure can be used to create a view for a
specific valuelist to be used in applications.

The Columns MFID and Name of the ValuelistItems in the
MFValuelistItems table is not unique as this table include all
valuelistitems accross all valuelists

After deployment of the Connector, the metadata of the vault are added to
the baseline metadata tables by synchronising the metadata using the
**spMFSynchronizeMetadata** procedure. When changes are made to the
metadata structure in M-Files using the administrator the same procedure
can be used to refresh the metadata. Note that metadata is not
automatically refreshed. It is refreshed on demand.Metadata maintenance

The **spMFSynchronizeSpecificMetadata** store procedure can be used to
refresh a specific type of metadata such as valueslist items or states.

Automated refresh of the metadata can be built into the deployment of
the specific application depending on the requirements for automation of
the refresh.

Refer to the 'Change of Vault' section in a case where the metadata in
the Connector are ported from one vault to another.


Metadata synchronization procedures
-----------------------------------

There are a number of store procedures  used for metadata
synchronization. Only three of these procedures are designed to be used
by the developer. The other procedures are all called by  these
procedures

Synchronize metadata for the first time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to synchronize the metadata tables with M-File server execute
the procedure :doc:`/procedures/spMFSynchronizeMetadata`.This
procedure will internally call internal procedures such as

-  spMFSynchronizeLoginAccount
-  spMFSynchronizeUserAccount
-  spMFSynchronizeObjectType
-  spMFSynchronizeProperties
-  spMFSynchronizeValueList
-  spMFSynchronizeValueListItems
-  spMFSynchronizeWorkflow
-  spMFSynchronizeWorkflowsStates
-  spMFSynchronizeClasses

Each spMFSynchronize\* procedure will internally call two
other procedures

spMFGet\*

spMFInsert\*

spMFGet\* procedure will connect to M-Files server and get the metadata
details in XML format and spMFInsert\* procedure will insert those
details into the respective metadata tables.

Synchronize specific metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :doc:`/procedures/spMFSynchronizeSpecificMetadata`
to update a specific type of metadata. 

Synchronize metadata Tables after the initial synchronisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When synchronising metadata during development use :doc:`/procedures/spMFDropAndUpdateMetadata`. This procedure allows for a number of special parameters to control different aspects of the synchronization

This procedure should always be executed after changes to metadata in the vault.  Failing to do so may cause errors.


Refresh all metadata:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard method of updating metadata from M-Files to SQL is to use
this procedure.  Note that this procedure will also record the update in
MFProcessBatch and MFProcessBatchDetail logging tables.

:doc:`/procedures/spMFSynchronizeMetadata`
:doc:`/procedures/spMFDropAndUpdateMetadata`

Use this procedure when a specific type of metadata is required to be
updated, or before the metadata must be updated from SQL to M-Files and a metadata change has taken place.

Metadata errors
---------------

Following is some of the errors that may arise and be reported
through email when working with metadata and how to resolve them.  These
errors may arise from deploying an update package on an existing
installation.

#. Unable to update record in SQL because null values are not allowed. 
#. No connection to the vault.

Change of workflow state names
------------------------------

When the name of a state is modified in M-Files, it does not trigger a
change of version of the underlying object and the name change there
does not replicate through to SQL. This is particularly relevant where
the state column in the class table is used in reporting.

The procedure :doc:`/procedures/spMFSynchronizeWorkFlowStateColumnChange` will
run through the class tables and update all state name changes.
