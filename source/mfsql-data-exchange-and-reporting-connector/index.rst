This  module is used where the Connector is deployed to perform data
exchange only with no need for development of integrations and
applications. This is particularly useful for reporting.

The Integration module include a range of additional helper
functions and procedures that may be useful in the case of extensive
data exchange operations.

Examples of usage of this module:

-  Extract metadata from M-Files into SQL for reporting, trouble
   shooting or analysis and data cleansing
-  Upload metadata from SQL into M-Files. This is particularly relevant
   when the data preparation is complex or require the extensive data
   management tools of SQL.
-  Simple extraction data from a third party system and updating the
   data into M-Files
-  Combine M-Files metadata with other corporate data that is not in
   M-Files for reporting and analysis
