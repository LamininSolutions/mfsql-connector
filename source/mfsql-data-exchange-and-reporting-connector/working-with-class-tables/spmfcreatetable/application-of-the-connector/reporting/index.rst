Reporting
=========

M-Files provides a full feature Reporting Add-on that is usually
deployed for advanced reporting.

The Connector in itself, and independently of the Reporting Add-on can
be used to expose the metadata in SQL for advanced reporting using any
report writer application that is capable of access SQL Tables and
Views.

One destinct benefit of using the Connector for reporting is that each
ClassTable contains not only the ID's of the valuelist items, but also
the values of the valuelist items which makes reporting significantly
easier as it is not necessary to build and maintain extensive
relationship views.
