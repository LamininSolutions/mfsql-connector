Usage examples of procedures and functions
==========================================

One of the advantages of the Connector is that the procedures is
functions in the Connector allows a developer to a wide range of
applications without any modification of the code.

In addition, custom procedures can be built do call the standard
procedures to extend the functionality and application further.

This section show examples of using the standard procedures and
functions over and above the application of these procedures in the
standard functionality of the Connector.

   Changing of Standard Procedures and Functions

   .. container:: confluence-information-macro-body

      Changes should not be made to any Procedure, Function, View or
      Table that is part of the core Connector Package. Changes will
      invalidate maintenance and upgrade of the code. Installing a later
      version of the Connector will automatically overwrite any changes
      to these objects. It all cases the developer should add custom
      functionality as a separate object and call the standard object
      where applicable. Your feedback, comments and requirements for
      extending the functionality is highly appreciated and may be
      considered for inclusion in later versions of the Connector.
