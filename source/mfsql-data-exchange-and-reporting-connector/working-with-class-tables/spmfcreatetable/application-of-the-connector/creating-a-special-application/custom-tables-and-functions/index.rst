Custom Tables and Functions
===========================

.. container::

   **Custom tables**: Additional tables, views, procedures and function
   can be added by the developer to be used with the Connector. These
   will depend on the specific application and deployment of the
   Connector. These procedures and functions are application specific
   and can be included in the Connector database or in a different
   database.

.. container::

   .. container:: alert alert-info

      Adhere to the naming conventions for Connector tables, functions
      and procedure to clearly differentiate custom items from the
      Connector objects to improve the maintenance and easy
      identification of additional items to the standard Connector
      entities.
