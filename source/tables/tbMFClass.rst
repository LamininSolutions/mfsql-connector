Additional Info
===============

Custom settings for the following columns will be retained when
:doc:`/procedures/spMFDropAndUpdateMetadata/` is used with the correct
parameters

#. The MFClass table is defines the classes included in the connector. The class table names is defined in column **TableName** in the MFClass Table. The Connector will create a default name with prefix **MF** for all the tables. These names can be edited.
#. The MFClass table column **IncludedInApp** has several functions. If this value is set to 1 then it indicates that the Class Table is specifically used in the application. This indicator is used in procedures to refresh or update all Class tables in the App with a single instruction, and are used in many other procedures to sub select classes included in the app. 
#. The **FileExportFolder** column?defines the root folder to be used when exporting files for the class. Refer to the :doc:`/procedures/spMFExportFiles/` .
#. The **SynchPrecedence** column defined the precedence for auto fixing of synchronization errors for the class. Refer to the :doc:`/mfsql-integration-connector/using-and-managing-logs/error-tracing/correcting-synchronization-errors/index`_.

The MFObjectType_ID references the primary key on the MFObjectType table. It is not the same as the M-Files internal ObjectType ID 

The MFWorkflow_ID references the primary key from the MFWorkflow table for the default workflow of the class as set in the metadata definition.  This ID is not the same as the Workflow internal ID.

The IsWorkflowEnforced column is set to 1 when the metadata definition is set to workflow enforced.  Updating a class table where the Workflow column is empty for an class that has workflow enforced will throw an error.

Foreign Keys
============

The MFClass table references the MFClassProperty, MFObjectType and Workflow tables

Examples
========

.. code:: sql

    -- show all tables included in app
    Select * from MFClass where includeInApp = 1

    -- use metadata structure view to explore class relationships with other objects
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[MFvwMetadataStructure] AS [mfms] WHERE class = 'Customer'
