Additional Info
===============

The status flag indicates:
 - 0 the record MFversion in M-Files and SQL is identical Flag
 - 1 the record MFversion in M-Files is higher than SQL. This indicates a need for updating from Mfiles to SQL 
 - 2 the SQL version is later than the M-Files version (usually signalling a syncronisation error) 
 - 3 the record in SQL is flagged as deleted in SQL and does not exist in M-Files
 - 4 the record is not in M-Files and the record flag in SQL is not deleted. This usually indicate that the routine for deleting records have not yet been processed.
 - 5 when there is no record in SQL for an objver in M-Files. This usually indicate that the records was created in M-Files and that the update routine has not yet been run. This may indicate a need for updating from Mfiles to SQL Note that all templates in M-Files will also show as statusflag 5 as templates are not inserted into SQL. Execute spmfUpdateTable to move the template objects to statusflag 6. 
 - 6 the Record is a template. This status flag is update by spmfUpdateTable.
 - 7 The record in SQL is marked as deleted but the record exist in M-Files (likely to have been undeleted.
