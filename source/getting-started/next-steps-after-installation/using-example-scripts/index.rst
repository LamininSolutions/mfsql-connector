Using example scripts
=====================

Examples scripts for the most common procedures and functions  are
included in the installation package.  The scripts are prepared using a
standard M-Files Sample vault and will include illustrations using
objects from this vault.

The scripts are located at:

-  InstallationFolder\Laminin Solutions\MFSQL Connector Release
   4\DatabaseName\Example Scripts

Open the scripts in SSMS.  Follow the guidelines in the scripts to
select the instructions in blocks rather than executing the entire
script.

.. container:: confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-tip

   .. container:: confluence-information-macro-body

      Use the scripts in conjunction with this guide.  The script only
      include a brief explanation or guide for the use of the different
      procedures and is not intended to replace this guide.
