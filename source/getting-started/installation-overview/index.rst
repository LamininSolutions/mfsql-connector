Key features of the installation package

-  The different modules are licensed by installing the license file to
   the vault applications. `Contact us <mailto:MFSQL@lamininsolutions.com>`__ if your license has expired.

-  The application will only operate with a valid license. Licenses
   expire when the subscription period runs out.
-  Selecting options in the installation package will install the

Deployment server model
-----------------------

Single Server Deployment Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Connector can be deployed in a single server where M-Files server
and SQL server is installed on the same server.

The Connect must be deployed in a separate Database on the SQL Server.
It is not required, but preferred for the Connector Database to be a
separate SQL instance from the M-Files vault SQL Database in cases where
the M-Files vault is also deployed as a SQL database.

Multi Server Deployment Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the Connector is used for integration with other applications or
for special application development, then a multi database deployment
model is preferred.

The following Server deployment is preferred in cases of high data
volume usage.

-  M-Files Server: Installation of the M-Files Server and vaults
-  SQL Server(s) with (separate instance for M-Files SQL vault
   databases)

   -  M-Files SQL Database
   -  Connector Database

-  SQL Server for special application databases

M-Files Cloud Deployment Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the Vault is on M-Files-Cloud and SQL Server is either on premise
or hosted

-  M-Files Cloud and SQL Server is connected with a VPN and in the same
   Domain
-  M-Files Cloud and SQL Server is not connected with a VPN

When the M-Files Cloud is connected with to the SQL Server with a VPN
the deployment model is the same as a Multi-Server Deployment

Special considerations apply when SQL Server is not connected with
M-Files Cloud. Follow the installation instructions specific to this
model.
