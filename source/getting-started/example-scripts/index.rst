Example scripts to get started 
==============================

Examples scripts for the most common procedures and functions are included. The scripts can be loaded from this guide or can be found in the installation folder.  The scripts are prepared using a standard M-Files Sample vault and will include illustrations using objects from this vault.

The scripts are located at: InstallationFolder\\Laminin Solutions\\MFSQL Connector Release 4\\DatabaseName\\Example Scripts

Open the scripts in SSMS. Follow the guidelines in the scripts to
select the instructions in blocks rather than executing the entire
script.

Use the scripts in conjunction with this guide.
