The context menu is used to control the procedure calls from M_files into the SQL
It is an integral part of building integral applications with MFSQL Connector

The following scripts illustrate adding or removing the most common type of items to and from the context menu table.

SELECT * FROM [dbo].[MFContextMenu] AS [mcm]

--the usergroups to be used in the menu can be obtained using a view
