Setup powershell utilities
==========================

Version 4.3.9.48 introduces several powershell utilities to enhance the
flexibility and deployment of Connection capabilities. Distinct
scenarios are covered:

#. SQL Express does not allow the use of agents.  The powershell
   utilities enable scheduled updates for SQL Express.
#. A Powershell utility is used to automate the updating of the M-Files
   version on the SQL server 
#. The File import from explorer is dependent on knowing the name and
   location of the file.  A powershell utility is used to update SQL
   with the file and folder data from explorer.

The powershell utilities is issued in Beta mode with version 4.3.9.48. 
We recommend to engage with us for the use and deployment of these
utilities to complete the setup and running of the utilities in your
environment.
