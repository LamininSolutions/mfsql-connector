   enabled
-  Ensure M-Files Desktop Client is installed on the M-Files Server and
   SQL server
-  Copy Sample Vault to create a new test vault to prototype with the
   Connector ; or use an existing vault
-  Install the package with windows administrator credentials. 
-  Connect to the M-Files server with system administration credentials
-  Setup a dedicated M-Files User for the vault. It is recommended to
   use M-Files authentication. However specific windows user can also be

The DB File Connector is only required if the functionality is needed to

transferring the files to M-Files.  Installing this connector will
require M-Files IML core to be licensed by your M-Files license.

Verify that the installation is connected to the correct Vault

Login into the SQL server with sysadmin credentials. The server name
must include the SQL Server \\ Instance.  Add the server port if a non
