 - Check Configurations / other applications / MFSQL Connector VaultApp Dashboard to see if it loading properly.  If it iscorrect, then uninstall and manually re-install the vault application from the installation files.

No such interface supported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes after an upgrade errors appear with 'No such interface supported' in the error description. It is likely that the error will also refer to an older version of M-Files.

An example is below:
A .NET Framework error occurred during execution of user-defined routine or aggregate "spMFCreatePublicSharedLinkInternal": System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: No such interface supported. CoVaultObjectOperations.cpp, 2462, No such interface supported. (0x80004002) Helper.cpp, 745, No such interface supported. (0x80004002) (M-Files 21.1.9827.4) (0028) System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: at LSConnect.MFiles.MFilesAccess.GetPublicLink(Int32 ObjectID, Int32 pDay, Int32 pMonth, Int32 pYear) at MFilesWrapper.GetPublicSharedLink(String VaultSettings, String XML, String& OutputXml) .

Probable cause:

One of the applications that is using the M-Files API's has loaded the previous version into memory.  The upgrade will not automatically release these older versions. However, MFSQL Connector cannot find the previous version.

Solution:

Restart the SQL server service.  If this does not resolve the issue, restart the SQL server.
