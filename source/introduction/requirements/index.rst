Detail
~~~~~~

**M-Files Version**

 - M-Files version 2018 and later
 - M-Files IML (Intelligent Metadata Layer) Core licence is required for the DB File Connector module

**M-Files User**

 - The connector requires a dedicated M-Files user with admin rights to the vault.  During installation the M-Files user must have Server Admin rights
 - It is recommended to assign a named user license to the user

**M-Files Database**

 - Firebird and SQL vaults allowed

**M-Files Installation**

 - Target vault must be pre-existing
 - M-Files client must be installed on SQL Server
 - Powershell must be installed and enabled on the SQL and M-Files server. The vault settings and application installation can be updated manually if powershell is not enabled
 - M-Files desktop client must be installed on M-Files Server
 - Each Vault requires a dedicated database
 - In it recommended to use a database naming conversion to link the database with the vault
 - It is recommended to have separate installations for Development and Production

**Powershell**

 - The Advanced installer use powershell as part of the installation on both SQL and M-Files server
 - Use manual install if powershell is not available.

**SQL Database**

 - SQL Server 2012, Express, Standard or Enterprise and later
 - All features is not supported in Express such as using agents, performance limitation
 - SQL Server must be installed with `Mixed Mode Authentication <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/change-server-authentication-mode>`__ during the setup of the instance

**M-Files to SQL connection**

 - MFSQL Connector use a ODBC connection or a web service to connect from M-Files to the SQL database.
 - We recommend to use the web service where the M-Files and SQL Server are not in the same network. 

**Size allocation of database**

 - Database is automatically created with default size and file locations.   The size of the database is not expected to be large or requiring any special requirements except if the M-Files vault is excessively large and the application requires a significant number of Class Tables. A Log Table purging methodology should be implemented to prevent excessive growth of application logs. By default log tables are kept indefinitely.

**SQL Server Configuration**

 - Database mail is required for SQL error notifications
 - Optional. Error message is available from MFLog table also

**DotNet Framework**

 - .Net 4.6.1 or higher on both SQL Server and Web Server

**Experience level of SQL Development**

 - Moderate experience with using MS-SQL queries are required

Reserved words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MFSQL Connector has several reserved words to be aware of.  The
following should be not be used in M-Files as names

-  Process or Process ID
-  GUID
-  ID
-  Update or Update ID
-  LastModified
-  FileCount
-  State, State_ID or State ID

Rename the default for property 39 'State' to something like 'Workflow
state' if another property with the name 'State' is required;
alternatively, rename the customer property to 'StateID'

Class Table Names cannot be the same as any of the default list of
tables created during installation (Such as MFProcess) 

Assumptions and constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Connector is intended to be used by an experienced consultant or
developer with a good knowledge of M-Files configuration and T-SQL . It
is not targeted to be end user application and assumes that the end user
will interact with the data via another user interface.

-  M-Files permission settings does not constrain access to the data in
   SQL. The data in SQL relies on access control implemented in SQL.
