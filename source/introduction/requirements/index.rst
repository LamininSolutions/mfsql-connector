Reserved words
--------------

MFSQL Connector has several reserved words to be aware of.  The
following should be not be used in M-Files as names

-  Process or Process ID
-  GUID
-  ID
-  Update or Update ID
-  LastModified
-  FileCount
-  State, State_ID or State ID

Rename the default for property 39 'State' to something like 'Workflow
state' if another property with the name 'State' is required;
alternatively, rename the customer property to 'StateID'

Class Table Names cannot be the same as any of the default list of
tables created during installation (Such as MFProcess) 



Assumptions and constraints
---------------------------

The Connector is intended to be used by an experienced consultant or
developer with a good knowledge of M-Files configuration and T-SQL . It
is not targeted to be end user application and assumes that the end user
will interact with the data via another user interface.

-  M-Files permission settings does not constrain access to the data in
   SQL. The data in SQL relies on access control implemented in SQL.
