Introducing MFSQL Connector
===========================

The introduction describes the background and purpose of the tool, elaborate on
the requirements for using the tool, highlights the assumptions and constraints
and provides guidance on how to get help.


Background
----------

   MFSQL Connector (The Connector) is a framework designed to allow
   M-Files to interact with MS SQL to enable a range of business cases
   including but not limited to:

   -  Integration of M-Files with other applications with two way
      integration between M-Files and MS SQL
   -  Creating M-Files Add-on applications using SQL as the extended
      database for these applications
   -  Advanced M-Files metadata cleansing and metadata management
   -  M-Files metadata reports using any report writer or integrating
      the reports with in-house web applications
   -  Accessing database files (blobs) in third party databases and
      making them available in M-Files

   The detail application of these uses are discussed in the sections

   -  `MFSQL data exchange and reporting connector`_
   -  `MFSQL Integration Connector`_
   -  `MFSQL Database File Connector`_

   The Connector is designed as a developer or consultant framework
   rather than an end user application. It is unlikely that a general
   M-Files user will interact directly with the Connector. However the
   special applications used by users will apply the Connector to
   operate on a day by day basis.

Purpose and scope
-----------------

The sole purpose of the Connector is to enhance the application of
M-Files using Microsoft SQL. The licensing, use and support for M-Files
and Microsoft SQL is assumed and separate from the Connector.

M-Files helps enterprises find, share, and secure documents and
information. At the same time, the integration with and access to
Microsoft SQL as the database, exposes the M-Files metadata for a range
of different types of applications. The Connector:

-  Enables reporting on any metadata with static, or dynamic reports
   with the ability to have near real time availability of data;
-  Allows for extensive metadata re-alignment, cleansing or
   manipulation;
-  Allows for building interfaces and integration with bespoke
   applications or other third party systems

The use and configuration of M-Files and SQL is not included in this
document. Refer to the application documentation for further details.
