Context Menu
============

The Context Menu provides the capability of executing a SQL Procedure or
navigate to a URL from M-Files. The Context Menu is dependendent the
M-Files Desktop client. it is not available in M-Files Web Access or
Mobile.

This capabilities allows for the following key features

#. Action button in M-Files task bar to open Menu items
#. Customisable menu items grouped by customisable group headings
#. Open URL in new browser when menu item is selected
#. Execute a procedure in the Connector database when menu item is
   selected
#. Right click on an object and execute an item from the menu to execute
   a store procedure with the object version details of the selected
   item as input parameters
#. Add script in workflow state action that will execute a store
   procedure in SQL

the Context menu

Refer to :doc:`/mfsql-data-exchange-and-reporting-connector/using-the-context-menu/index`

      Note that the Context Menu is installed and operates as a separate
      module of the Connector and requires the installation of the Data
      Exchange module to operate.

      Context Menu Procedures
      =======================

      The context menu relies on procedures with a predefined structure.

      The procedure spMFGetContectMenu is used by the application and should
      not be modified.

      The functionality provides for two types of procedures to be executed:

      #. Procedure without any input parameters
      #. procedure using the object version of the of the M-Files object in
         context as input parameter.

      The name of the procedure must be added in the column *Action* in
      MFContextMenu table for the menu item that will be used to execute the
      action.

      The procedure will be executed when the menu item is select. The intent
      is that this procedure will call the custom procedure that controls the
      execution of the desired process. On completion the output message of
      the this procedure will be return to the user in M-Files.

      Procedure without input parameter (action type 1)
      -------------------------------------------------

      **Execute Procedure**

      .. code:: sql

          CREATE PROCEDURE [contmenu].[procname]
          @OutPut varchar(1000) Output
          as
          Begin

            Begin Try
             --Call procedure to perform operation and return output message
             set @OutPut='Operation successful'
            End Try
            Begin Catch
             set @OutPut='Error:'
             set @OutPut=@OutPut+(select ERROR_MESSAGE())
            End Catch
          End



      Procedure with object version as input parameter (action type 3)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

      **Execute Procedure**

      .. code:: sql

          Create Procedure contmenu.procname
          @ObjectID int,
          @ObjectType int,
          @ObjectVer int,
          @OutPut varchar(1000) Output
          as
          begin
            Begin Try
          --Call procedure to perform operation using the object details as input and return output message
             set @OutPut='Operation successful'
            End Try
            Begin Catch
             set @OutPut='Error:'
             set @OutPut=@OutPut+(select ERROR_MESSAGE())
            End Catch
          End

      Formatting result message for UI
      --------------------------------

      The procedure spMFResultMessageForUI is specifically targeted at
      providing a formatted message to be returned to the UI to improve the
      user message on completion of the procedure.

      This procedure is called from the main procedure than controls the
      process to return and error or to return to successful completion. Â It
      also assumes that the main procedure utilizes the MFProcessBatch table
      to log to outcome of the procedure.

      the message returned is the result of the procedure as recorded in the
      MFProcessBatch.

      Line Breaks in output
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      insert '\n' in the string to insert line breaks in the output
      message :

      for example:

      .. code:: text

          set @OutPut= 'ObjectID='+CAST(@ObjectID as varchar(10))+ '/n' + ' ObjectType='+cast(@ObjectType as varchar(10))+

      .. code:: text

         + '/n' + ' ObjectVer='+ cast(@ObjectVer as varchar(10))
