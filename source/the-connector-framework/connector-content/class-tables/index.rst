Class tables

Class Table Columns
--------------------

Class tables are not added by the Connector on deployment. The class
tables are added by the developer using the Connector for those M-Files
classes that will be used in the application. See Functional
Description for the creation and use of the class tables.

Table Name: The name of the class table is defined in column TableName
in the MFClass Table. The Connector will create a default name for all
the tables. These names can be edited.

Column Name: The columns in the Class Tables is automatically assigned
on creation. The name of the column is defined in the MFProperty Table
in the column 'ColumnName'. These names can be edited.

Column Definitions: Several special columns are automatically created.
The column order also has a very specific arrangement. See Table Columns
for further detail.

Class Tables and there columns
------------------------------

All of the columns defined in the MFClassProperty Table for the
specified class will be included in the Class Table with the data types
defined above.

Where a property has an ID column and a name column (For example
Customer and Customer_ID) the name column is incidental and does not
have to be updated when changes are made. Only the ID have to be
updated. The name column will be automatically refreshed from the
metadata.

MF Ad-hoc Columns
-----------------

M-Files allow the addition of ad-hoc properties. Also, when a property
is dropped from the metadata definition in M-Files and already have
values on an object, then the property will retain its value.

When the Connector finds an additional property on an object, and it is
not part of the metadata card, then a column will be added to the end of
the Class Table with the columnname and datatype definitions as
previously described.

Non Connector Columns
---------------------

It is possible to add columns to the class table that will be ignored by
the Connector but is available for processing in the application. These
columns must have a prefix of MX\_ (for example MX_SAGE_Code)

Notwithstanding the ability to add additional columns to the Connector
tables following the convension above, it is recommended to create
additional tables for custom applications that is cross referenced to
the Connector tables rather than adding columns to Connector tables.

Special columns
---------------

    Required (NOT NULL)

      If the metadata is a required property as defined in the MFClassProperty
      table then the column will be created with a NOT NULL constraint.

    Column

        The columns that will be created for the table is derived from the
        following:

        -  Default column
        -  Derived from the MFClassProperty Table.
        -  Add - Hoc columns
        -  Non Connector columns

Default columns
---------------

The default columns are created on every class table irrespective of the
mapping of metadata for the specific class. These columns must not be
dropped or renamed. They are located in different sections of the table.

The following sample statement will list all properties in the vault and
the relationship to the classes.

.. code:: sql

   SELECT * FROM [dbo].[MFClassProperty]
   AS [mcp]INNER
   JOIN [dbo].[MFClass] AS [mc]ON [mc].[ID] = [mcp].[MFClass_ID]
   INNER JOIN [dbo].[MFProperty] AS [mp]ON [mp].[ID] = [mcp].[MFProperty_ID]
   ORDER BY mc.mfid, mp.mfid asc

The following standard properties are included by default on every class
table:

-  Name or title
-  Created
-  Last modified
-  Last modified by
-  Created by

Process_id values
-----------------

== ==================== =====================================================
ID Name                 Description
1  Update               Set by user to show record to be updated by Connector
2  Syncronisation Error Set by Connector to show Syncronisation errors
3  SQLError             Set by Connector to show record with SQL error
4  MFError              Set by Connector to show record with MF error
== ==================== =====================================================

By default the process_ID on the class table is 0.

Refer to error management for more information on handling errors 

Refer to Update ClassTable records for more information on the use of
these process id's.

Indexes on class tables
--------------------------

The use of indexes on class tables could materially improve the efficiency and processing of objects, especially in larger tables.

Indexes is applied specific to the use of columns in the tables.  The Connector provides flexibility regarding the use of indexes.

We recommend to at least set indexes on the objid and external_id columns.  In some cases you may choose to set indexes on these columns in combination with other columns to improve additional efficiency.

MFSettings include a default setting for the creation of indexes. This setting is introduced in version 4.6.16.57.  By default the automatic creation of indexes is set to 0 (do not created indexes).

When this setting is set to 1 then spMFCreateTable will automatically create indexes on objid and external_id.

.. code:: sql

     SELECT * FROM dbo.MFSettings AS ms WHERE name = 'CreateUniqueClassIndexes'

     UPDATE ms
     SET value = '1'
     FROM dbo.MFSettings AS ms
     WHERE name = 'CreateUniqueClassIndexes'

Execute the procedure spMFSetUniqueIndexes to set indexes on all existing class tables, rather than recreating the tables from scratch.

.. code:: sql

   EXEC spmfsetuniqueindexes

Object change history
---------------------

The :doc:`/tables/tbMFObjectChangeHistory/` table include the object change history across all classes

MFSQL allows for extracting the change history for specific objects and for specific properties of these objects.

The data is shown as a row for each version and property change.  The table includes data accross all classes but will only show the data that has previously been extracting using the related procedures.

The table :doc:`/tables/tbMFChangeHistoryUpdateControl/` is used for setting up the properties and tables to be included in the get history process.

Object Versions
---------------

The class tables contain the full object detail including properties of an object.  On the other hand, the Connector also provides for and use the capability of extracting the Object Version only from M-Files.  This significantly improves the effficiency of determining the latest object version and status of an object.

The :doc:`/tables/tbMFAuditHistory/` table contains the object version detail of all classes where the data has been extracted from M-Files.
