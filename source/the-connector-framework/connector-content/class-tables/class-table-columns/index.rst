Class Table Columns
===================

Class tables are not added by the Connector on deployment. The class
tables are added by the developer using the Connector for those M-Files
classes that will be used in the application. See Functional
Description for the creation and use of the class tables.

Table Name: The name of the class table is defined in column TableName
in the MFClass Table. The Connector will create a default name for all
the tables. These names can be edited.

Column Name: The columns in the Class Tables is automatically assigned
on creation. The name of the column is defined in the MFProperty Table
in the column 'ColumnName'. These names can be edited.

Column Definitions: Several special columns are automatically created.
The column order also has a very specific arrangement. See Table Columns
for further detail.

 



Class Tables and there columns
------------------------------

All of the columns defined in the MFClassProperty Table for the
specified class will be included in the Class Table with the data types
defined above.

Where a property has an ID column and a name column (For example
Customer and Customer_ID) the name column is incidental and does not
have to be updated when changes are made. Only the ID have to be
updated. The name column will be automatically refreshed from the
metadata.



MF Ad-hoc Columns
-----------------

M-Files allow the addition of ad-hoc properties. Also, when a property
is dropped from the metadata definition in M-Files and already have
values on an object, then the property will retain its value.

When the Connector finds an additional property on an object, and it is
not part of the metadata card, then a column will be added to the end of
the Class Table with the columnname and datatype definitions as
previously described.



Non Connector Columns
---------------------

It is possible to add columns to the class table that will be ignored by
the Connector but is available for processing in the application. These
columns must have a prefix of MX\_ (for example MX_SAGE_Code)

Notwithstanding the ability to add additional columns to the Connector
tables following the convension above, it is recommended to create
additional tables for custom applications that is cross referenced to
the Connector tables rather than adding columns to Connector tables.



Special columns
---------------



Required (NOT NULL)
                   

If the metadata is a required property as defined in the MFClassProperty
table then the column will be created with a NOT NULL constraint.



Columns
       

The columns that will be created for the table is derived from the
following:

-  Default column
-  Derived from the MFClassProperty Table.
-  Add - Hoc columns
-  Non Connector columns



Default columns
---------------

The default columns are created on every class table irrespective of the
mapping of metadata for the specific class. These columns must not be
dropped or renamed. They are located in different sections of the table.

The following standard properties are included by default on every class
table:

-  Name or title
-  Created
-  Last modified
-  Last modified by
