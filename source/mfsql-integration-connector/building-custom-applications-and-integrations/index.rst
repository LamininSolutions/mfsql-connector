The main focus of the Connector is to allow for building small and large
custom applications and integrations around M-Files. Â Building these
applications does not require deep knowledge of the M-Files API's or
.Net Application development although it may be useful in some cases.
The Connector is built for and is very useful in the hands of someone
with T-SQL query experience.
