Metadata Management and Realignment
===================================

Brown MacFarlane, a steel merchant, selected MFSQL Connector for their integration between M-Files and Navision. Part of the project was to migrate and align the data from their previous ERP system with Navision and M-Files.

This process relied heavily on the power of SQL to compare, align, transform and update several sources and destinations of data tables.  MFSQL Connector built in tools and capabilities significantly reduced to time to prepare for and perform the metadata extract and alignment, and subsequently updating of the tabled data to and from M-Files.

Metadata re-alignment during the course of the analysis and design of the integration played a part in the project. This case study highlights some of the procedure, methods and approaches applied during this project.
