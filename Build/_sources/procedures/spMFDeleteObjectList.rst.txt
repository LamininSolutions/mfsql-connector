Purpose
=======

Procedure to delete a series of objects

Prerequisites
=============

Set process_id of objects to be deleted in the class table prior to running the delete procedure.

Additional info
===============

The return value from M-Files for the deletions include a status code and result message.  The return values are logged in the MFUpdateHistory table.

The following status codes are used:

 - 1 = Success object deleted
 - 2 = Success object version destroyed
 - 3 = Success object destroyed
 - 4 = Failed to destroy, object not found
 - 5 = Failed to delete, object not found
 - 6 = Failed to remove version, version not found

Use the parameter RetainDeletions = 1 to retain the deletions in the class table. The timestamp for the deletion will show in the deleted column.

The updated version and deleted state of the deleted record is also shown in the MFAuditHistory table.

Warning
=======

Deletions showing in the class table will be removed when the update procedure is run withoput retain deletions.  The next time this procedure is run showing deletions, all the deletions will be shown again in the class table.
