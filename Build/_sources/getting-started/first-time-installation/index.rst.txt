Installation scenarios
----------------------

Different server configurations could give rise to different installation methods.

Separate servers on premise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
M-Files server and SQL Server is separate servers in the same domain network. This is the recommended and most common scenario for production environments.

Use the standard Installation method. Install the package on each server selecting the options for the server type. Start with M-Files Server.

Single Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 M-Files Server and SQL Server is on the same box (server or workstation). This is the most common scenario for test and development environments.

 Use the standard installation and select all the installation options at the same time.

M-Files server and SQL Server on different domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The servers are not connected within a common domain. Consider the following:

  - Administrative access to install software on the servers
  - Access from M-Files server to SQL on the SQL server via ODBC
  - Access from M-Files server to SQL on the SQL server via Web API
  - Sysadmin rights on the SQL Server

Additional steps to the basic installation is required when any of the above restrictions apply.

M-Files Cloud installation falls within this scope as administrative access to the M-Files Server is restricted to M-Files support only.

Refer to the next section for these types of installation.
