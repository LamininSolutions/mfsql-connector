M-Files SQL Database Connector is a vault application that adds a
connection to files in a SQL Table to an M-Files document vault. The
connector allows documents and other files residing in a SQL database
to be viewed via the M-Files user interface in a similar manner as
other documents and objects in the vault.

Using MFSQL Integration Connector it is now also possible to export files from Database Blobs into M-Files.  This feature can be used in conjunction with the Database File Connector.

This document provides the instructions for installing and configuring
M-Files SQL Database Connector.
