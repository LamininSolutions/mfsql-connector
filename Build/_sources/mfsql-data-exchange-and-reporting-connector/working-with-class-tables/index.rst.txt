Overview
--------

The Class tables refer to all the documents and other objects in the vault such as customers, customer documents, contacts etc. Any class as defined in the M-Files vault is a class table.

The class tables are not automatically created as the assumption is that an application or use case for the connection may only use a sub section of all the classes in the vault. A listing of all the classes is in MFClass.

Class tables can therefore be created on demand, updated in SQL and synchronized with M-Files either in batch mode or in transaction mode.

This section show how to work with the class tables.
